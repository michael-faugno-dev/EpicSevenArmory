# Privacy Policy — Epic Seven Armory

**Last updated: February 28, 2026**

Epic Seven Armory ("the App", "the Extension") is a fan-made tool for the mobile game *Epic Seven*. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and your rights.

---

## 1. What We Collect

### Desktop App (Epic Seven Armory)
When you create an account and use the desktop app, we store:

- **Google account info** — your name, email address, and Google user ID, collected during Google Sign-In and used solely to create and authenticate your account.
- **In-game profile data** — your Epic Seven account name and RTA rank, entered manually by you.
- **Unit stats** — attack, defense, health, speed, critical hit chance/damage, effectiveness, effect resistance, and equipment set names for units you upload.
- **Twitch account link** — if you choose to link your Twitch account, we store your Twitch user ID, login name, and display name.

### Twitch Extension (E7 Armory Unit Overlay)
When a broadcaster installs the extension:

- **Twitch channel ID** — provided by Twitch to identify which channel the extension is active on. Used only to map the channel to an Armory username.
- **Armory username** — entered by the broadcaster in the extension config page and stored so the overlay can display their selected units to viewers.

Viewers do not submit any data. The extension displays the broadcaster's selected unit stats in read-only form.

- To authenticate you and display your profile.
- To store and display your selected units in the Twitch overlay.
- To verify Twitch account ownership when linking accounts.
